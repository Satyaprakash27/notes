Remember that:
- **Context Matters**: What works for one system may not work for another
- **Requirements Change**: Be prepared to adapt your architecture
- **Simplicity is Valuable**: Avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Measure and Learn**: Use data to validate your decisions

The goal is not to avoid all trade-offs but to make conscious, well-informed decisions that best serve your system's needs. Regular review and evolution of your architecture ensures it continues to meet changing requirements and takes advantage of new technologies and patterns.

By understanding the trade-offs discussed in this guide and applying the decision framework, you'll be better equipped to design systems that are robust, scalable, and maintainable while meeting your specific business and technical requirements.
