## File Storage vs Object Storage

### File Storage
File storage is the traditional hierarchical storage system where data is organized in folders and files with a directory structure.

#### Characteristics:
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Files are organized in a tree-like directory structure
- **POSIX Compliance**: Supports standard file operations (read, write, delete, rename)
- **Metadata**: Limited metadata capabilities
- **Access Protocol**: Accessed via file system protocols (NFS, SMB, CIFS)
- **Scalability**: Limited horizontal scalability

#### Use Cases:
- Traditional applications requiring file system access
- Shared file systems in enterprise environments
- Home directories and user data
- Legacy application migration

#### Advantages:
- Familiar interface for users and applications
- Strong consistency guarantees
- POSIX compliance for compatibility
- Fine-grained access control

#### Disadvantages:
- Limited scalability compared to object storage
- Complex metadata management
- Difficult to distribute across multiple locations
- Performance bottlenecks with large numbers of files

### Object Storage
Object storage stores data as objects in a flat namespace, with each object containing data, metadata, and a unique identifier.

#### Characteristics:
- **Flat Namespace**: No hierarchical directory structure
- **Rich Metadata**: Extensive metadata capabilities
- **Unique Identifiers**: Each object has a unique ID or key
- **REST APIs**: Accessed via HTTP/HTTPS REST APIs
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Designed for massive scale

#### Use Cases:
- Web applications and mobile apps
- Content distribution and media storage
- Backup and archival systems
- Data lakes and analytics
- Static website hosting

#### Advantages:
- Virtually unlimited scalability
- Cost-effective for large amounts of data
- Rich metadata capabilities
- Built-in redundancy and durability
- Geographic distribution capabilities

#### Disadvantages:
- No file system semantics
- Eventual consistency in some systems
- Learning curve for traditional file-based applications
- Limited transaction support

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | File Storage | Object Storage |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Structure | Hierarchical | Flat namespace |
| Scalability | Limited | Virtually unlimited |
| Metadata | Basic | Rich and extensible |
| Access Method | File system protocols | REST APIs |
| Consistency | Strong | Eventual (typically) |
| Cost | Higher per GB | Lower per GB |
| Performance | Lower latency | Higher throughput |

### Blob Store Design Patterns:

#### 1. Partitioning Strategy
```
/year/month/day/hour/object_id
/tenant_id/object_type/object_id
/hash_prefix/object_id
```

#### 2. Naming Conventions
- Use meaningful prefixes for better organization
- Include timestamps for time-based queries
- Avoid sequential naming to prevent hotspots

#### 3. Metadata Management
- Store searchable metadata as object tags

- Index metadata for efficient queries

### Best Practices:
- **Naming**: Use descriptive and consistent naming conventions
- **Versioning**: Enable versioning for critical data
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Lifecycle**: Implement lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- **Access Control**: Use fine-grained access controls
