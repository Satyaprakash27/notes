## Introduction

Monitoring and observability are crucial aspects of modern system design that enable teams to understand system behavior, detect issues, and maintain system reliability. While monitoring focuses on collecting predefined metrics and alerts, observability provides deeper insights into system internal states based on external outputs.

### Key Differences:
- **Monitoring**: Answers "What is happening?" through predefined metrics
- **Observability**: Answers "Why is it happening?" through comprehensive data analysis

## The Three Pillars of Observability

### 1. Logs
- **Purpose**: Provide detailed records of discrete events
- **Use Cases**: Debugging, auditing, compliance
- **Format**: Structured (JSON) or unstructured text

### 2. Metrics
- **Purpose**: Provide quantitative measurements over time
- **Use Cases**: Performance monitoring, capacity planning, alerting
- **Format**: Time-series data with labels

### 3. Traces
- **Purpose**: Track request flow across distributed systems
- **Use Cases**: Performance optimization, dependency mapping
- **Format**: Distributed traces with spans and timing information

## Logging

### Overview
Logging is the practice of recording events that happen in your application. It provides a detailed audit trail and is essential for debugging and understanding system behavior.

### ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

#### Architecture
```
Application → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana
```

#### Components:

**Elasticsearch**
- Distributed search and analytics engine
- Stores and indexes log data
- Provides fast search capabilities
- Supports clustering for high availability

**Logstash**
- Data processing pipeline
- Ingests data from multiple sources
- Transforms and enriches log data
- Outputs to various destinations

**Kibana**
- Visualization and analytics platform
- Creates dashboards and charts
- Provides search interface
- Supports alerting and monitoring

#### Benefits:
- **Centralized Logging**: All logs in one place
- **Real-time Analysis**: Search and analyze logs immediately
- **Scalability**: Handle large volumes of log data
- **Visualization**: Rich dashboards and charts

### Log Levels
```
TRACE → DEBUG → INFO → WARN → ERROR → FATAL
```

### Best Practices for Logging:

1. **Use Structured Logging**
   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "2025-07-06T10:30:00Z",
     "level": "INFO",
     "service": "user-service",
     "message": "User login successful",
     "user_id": "12345",
     "request_id": "abc-123",
     "duration_ms": 150
   }
   ```

2. **Include Context**
   - Request IDs for tracing
   - User IDs for security
   - Service names for identification

3. **Log Sampling**
   - Sample high-volume debug logs
   - Always log errors and warnings
   - Use different sampling rates for different environments

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens)
   - Mask or hash personal information
   - Implement log retention policies

## Metrics

### Overview
Metrics are numerical measurements that provide insights into system performance and behavior over time. They enable proactive monitoring and capacity planning.

### Prometheus

#### Architecture
```
Application → Prometheus → Grafana
     ↓
   Alertmanager
```

#### Key Features:
- **Pull-based Model**: Scrapes metrics from targets
- **Time-series Database**: Optimized for time-based data
- **PromQL**: Powerful query language
- **Service Discovery**: Automatically discovers targets
- **Alerting**: Built-in alerting rules

#### Metric Types:

1. **Counter**
   - Monotonically increasing value
   - Example: Total HTTP requests
   ```
   http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200"} 1500
   ```

2. **Gauge**
   - Current value that can go up or down
   - Example: Current memory usage
   ```
   memory_usage_bytes{instance="web-1"} 1073741824
   ```

3. **Histogram**
   - Samples observations and counts them in buckets
   - Example: HTTP request duration
   ```
   http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.1"} 100
   http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"} 200
   ```

4. **Summary**
   - Similar to histogram but calculates quantiles
   - Example: Request latency quantiles
   ```
   http_request_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 0.05
   http_request_duration_seconds{quantile="0.95"} 0.2
   ```

- **Tables**: Tabular data display

### Key Metrics to Monitor:

#### Application Metrics:
- **Request Rate**: Requests per second
- **Response Time**: P50, P95, P99 latencies
- **Error Rate**: 4xx/5xx error percentages
- **Throughput**: Business transactions per unit time

#### Infrastructure Metrics:
- **CPU Utilization**: Percentage usage

- **Revenue**: Financial metrics
- **Feature Usage**: Feature adoption rates

## Tracing

### Overview
Distributed tracing tracks requests as they flow through multiple services, providing end-to-end visibility in microservices architectures.

### OpenTelemetry

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Trace**: Complete request journey
2. **Span**: Individual operation within a trace
3. **Context**: Metadata passed between services
4. **Baggage**: Key-value pairs propagated across services

#### Span Structure:
```
Trace ID: abc123
├── Span: HTTP Request (Service A)
│   ├── Span: Database Query (Service A)
│   └── Span: API Call to Service B
│       ├── Span: Business Logic (Service B)
│       └── Span: Cache Lookup (Service B)
```

#### Benefits:
- **Vendor Agnostic**: Works with multiple backends
- **Standardized**: Common APIs and formats
- **Auto-instrumentation**: Automatic tracing for popular frameworks
- **Custom Instrumentation**: Manual span creation

### Jaeger

#### Architecture:
```
Application → Jaeger Agent → Jaeger Collector → Storage → Jaeger UI
```

#### Components:

**Jaeger Agent**
- Lightweight daemon

## Health Checks and Alerts

### Health Checks

#### Types:

1. **Liveness Checks**
   - Determines if application is running
   - Triggers container restart if failing
   - Example: HTTP endpoint returns 200

2. **Readiness Checks**
   - Determines if application is ready to serve traffic
   - Removes from load balancer if failing
   - Example: Database connection successful

3. **Deep Health Checks**
   - Comprehensive system validation
   - Checks dependencies and resources
   - Example: Database query execution

#### Implementation:
```python
# Example health check endpoint
@app.route('/health/live')
def liveness():
    return {'status': 'healthy', 'timestamp': datetime.now()}

@app.route('/health/ready')
def readiness():
    try:
        # Check database connection
        db.execute('SELECT 1')
        return {'status': 'ready', 'timestamp': datetime.now()}
    except Exception as e:
        return {'status': 'not ready', 'error': str(e)}, 503
```

### Alerting

#### Alert Types:

1. **Threshold-based Alerts**
   - Triggered when metric exceeds threshold
   - Example: CPU usage > 80%

2. **Anomaly-based Alerts**
   - Triggered by unusual patterns
   - Example: Request rate 3x higher than normal

3. **Compound Alerts**
   - Multiple conditions combined
   - Example: High CPU AND high memory

#### Alert Fatigue Prevention:

1. **Proper Thresholds**
   - Set realistic alert thresholds
   - Use different thresholds for different environments
   - Implement alert suppression

2. **Alert Grouping**
   - Group related alerts
   - Reduce notification noise
   - Provide context

3. **Alert Escalation**
   - Escalate unacknowledged alerts
   - Route to appropriate teams
   - Implement follow-up actions

#### SLA-based Alerting:

1. **Error Budget**
   - Define acceptable error rates
   - Alert when budget is consumed
   - Balance reliability and development speed

2. **SLI/SLO Framework**
   - Service Level Indicators (SLI): Metrics
   - Service Level Objectives (SLO): Targets
   - Service Level Agreements (SLA): Contracts
