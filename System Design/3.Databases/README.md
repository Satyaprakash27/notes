- Specific performance requirements for read/write operations

### üìä Database Indexing

Database indexing is a critical optimization technique that dramatically improves query performance by creating efficient data access paths, similar to an index in a book that helps locate information quickly.

#### Index Fundamentals

**What is an Index:**
An index is a separate data structure that maintains a sorted reference to data in the main table, allowing the database engine to locate records without scanning the entire table.

**Index Structure:**
- **B-Tree Index:** Most common index type, balanced tree structure for range queries
- **Hash Index:** Fast equality lookups but no range queries
- **Bitmap Index:** Efficient for low-cardinality data with few distinct values
- **Composite Index:** Multiple columns combined into a single index

#### Types of Indexes

##### Primary Index
- **Definition:** Automatically created for primary key columns
- **Characteristics:** Unique, non-null, clustered (data physically ordered)
- **Use Case:** Direct record access via primary key

##### Secondary Index
- **Definition:** Additional indexes on non-primary key columns
- **Characteristics:** May be unique or non-unique, typically non-clustered
- **Use Case:** Optimize queries on frequently searched columns

##### Clustered Index
- **Definition:** Index where data pages are physically ordered by index key
- **Characteristics:** One per table, determines physical storage order
- **Performance:** Excellent for range queries, slower for inserts/updates

##### Non-Clustered Index
- **Definition:** Index with logical ordering separate from physical storage
- **Characteristics:** Multiple per table, points to data locations
- **Performance:** Good for equality searches, requires key lookup for full data

#### Index Design Strategies

**Single-Column Indexes:**
```sql
-- Create index on frequently queried column
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);

-- Query optimization
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
-- Uses idx_user_email for fast lookup
```

**Composite Indexes:**
```sql
-- Create composite index for multi-column queries
CREATE INDEX idx_user_name_age ON users(last_name, first_name, age);

-- Optimized queries (left-most prefix rule)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_name = 'Smith' AND first_name = 'John';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_name = 'Smith' AND first_name = 'John' AND age = 30;
```

**Partial Indexes:**
```sql
-- Index only specific subset of data
CREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users(email) WHERE status = 'active';

-- Reduces index size and maintenance overhead
```

#### Index Performance Considerations

**Benefits:**
- **Query Speed:** Dramatically faster SELECT operations
- **Sorting:** Efficient ORDER BY operations
- **Grouping:** Faster GROUP BY operations
- **Uniqueness:** Enforce unique constraints efficiently

**Costs:**
- **Storage Overhead:** Additional disk space for index structures
- **Maintenance Cost:** Indexes must be updated on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
- **Memory Usage:** Indexes consume memory for caching
- **Insert Performance:** Slower writes due to index maintenance

#### Index Optimization Best Practices

**Column Selection:**
- Index columns used in WHERE clauses frequently
- Consider columns used in JOIN conditions
- Index columns used in ORDER BY clauses
- Avoid indexing columns with high update frequency

**Index Maintenance:**
- Monitor index usage statistics
- Remove unused indexes to reduce overhead
- Rebuild fragmented indexes periodically
- Consider index consolidation for similar queries

### üîÑ Data Modeling

Data modeling is the process of creating a conceptual representation of data structures, relationships, and constraints that will be implemented in a database system.

#### Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams

**Components of ER Diagrams:**

##### Entities
- **Definition:** Objects or concepts about which data is stored
- **Examples:** Customer, Product, Order, Employee
- **Representation:** Rectangles in ER diagrams
- **Types:** Strong entities (independent) vs weak entities (dependent)

##### Attributes
- **Definition:** Properties or characteristics of entities
- **Types:**
  - **Simple:** Cannot be divided further (e.g., age, name)
  - **Composite:** Can be divided into sub-attributes (e.g., address)
  - **Derived:** Calculated from other attributes (e.g., age from birth_date)
  - **Multi-valued:** Can have multiple values (e.g., phone_numbers)

##### Relationships
- **Definition:** Associations between entities
- **Cardinality:** Number of instances that can participate
  - **One-to-One (1:1):** Each entity instance relates to one instance of another
  - **One-to-Many (1:M):** One entity instance relates to many instances of another
  - **Many-to-Many (M:N):** Multiple instances relate to multiple instances

**ER Diagram Example:**
```
Customer (CustomerID, Name, Email, Phone)
    |
    | (1:M)
    |
Order (OrderID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, CustomerID)
    |
    | (M:N)
    |
Product (ProductID, ProductName, Price, StockQuantity)
```

#### Database Normalization

Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and dependency, ensuring data integrity and efficient storage.

##### First Normal Form (1NF)
**Requirements:**
- Each column contains atomic (indivisible) values
- Each row is unique
- No repeating groups or arrays

**Example:**
```sql
-- Violates 1NF (multi-valued attribute)
Customer (ID, Name, Phone)
1, John Smith, "555-1234, 555-5678"

-- Normalized to 1NF
Customer (ID, Name)
1, John Smith

CustomerPhone (CustomerID, Phone)
1, 555-1234
1, 555-5678
```

##### Second Normal Form (2NF)
**Requirements:**
- Must be in 1NF
- All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key
- Eliminates partial dependencies

**Example:**
```sql
-- Violates 2NF (partial dependency)
OrderItem (OrderID, ProductID, ProductName, Quantity, Price)
-- ProductName depends only on ProductID, not full key

-- Normalized to 2NF
OrderItem (OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, Price)
Product (ProductID, ProductName)
```

##### Third Normal Form (3NF)
**Requirements:**
- Must be in 2NF
- No transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depend only on primary key)
- Eliminates indirect dependencies

**Example:**
```sql
-- Violates 3NF (transitive dependency)
Employee (EmployeeID, Name, DepartmentID, DepartmentName)
-- DepartmentName depends on DepartmentID, not EmployeeID

-- Normalized to 3NF
Employee (EmployeeID, Name, DepartmentID)
Department (DepartmentID, DepartmentName)
```

##### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
**Requirements:**
- Must be in 3NF
- Every determinant must be a candidate key
- Stricter version of 3NF

##### Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
**Requirements:**
- Must be in BCNF
- No multi-valued dependencies
- Eliminates independent multi-valued facts

#### Denormalization Strategies

**When to Denormalize:**
- Performance requirements outweigh storage concerns
- Read-heavy applications with complex joins
- Data warehouse and analytical systems
- Distributed systems where joins are expensive

**Denormalization Techniques:**
- **Redundant Data:** Store frequently accessed data in multiple tables
- **Computed Columns:** Pre-calculate expensive aggregations
- **Materialized Views:** Store pre-computed query results
- **Flattened Structures:** Combine normalized tables for specific use cases

### üí≥ Transactions and ACID Properties

Transactions are fundamental units of work in database systems that ensure data integrity and consistency, especially in concurrent environments.

#### Transaction Fundamentals

**Definition:** A transaction is a sequence of database operations that are executed as a single logical unit of work.

**Transaction States:**
- **Active:** Transaction is currently executing
- **Partially Committed:** Transaction has executed but not yet committed
- **Committed:** Transaction has completed successfully
- **Aborted:** Transaction has been rolled back
- **Failed:** Transaction cannot proceed due to errors

#### ACID Properties

##### Atomicity
**Definition:** All operations in a transaction succeed or fail together (all-or-nothing principle).

**Implementation:**
- **Logging:** Write-ahead logging to record all changes
- **Rollback:** Ability to undo all changes if transaction fails
- **Savepoints:** Partial rollback to specific points in transaction

**Example:**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
    -- If either update fails, both are rolled back
COMMIT;
```

##### Consistency
**Definition:** Database must remain in a valid state before and after transaction execution.

**Mechanisms:**
- **Constraints:** Primary keys, foreign keys, check constraints
- **Triggers:** Business rule enforcement
- **Data Types:** Type checking and validation
- **Referential Integrity:** Maintaining relationships between tables

**Example:**
```sql
-- Consistency ensured through constraints
ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customer
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id);

-- Invalid customer_id will be rejected
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, total) VALUES (999, 100.00);
-- Error: Customer ID 999 does not exist
```

##### Isolation
**Definition:** Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.

**Isolation Levels:**

###### Read Uncommitted
- **Level:** Lowest isolation
- **Characteristics:** Can read uncommitted changes from other transactions
- **Problems:** Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads
- **Use Case:** Reporting where approximate data is acceptable

###### Read Committed
- **Level:** Default in most databases
- **Characteristics:** Only reads committed data
- **Problems:** Non-repeatable reads, phantom reads
- **Use Case:** Most general-purpose applications

###### Repeatable Read
- **Level:** Higher isolation
- **Characteristics:** Consistent reads within transaction
- **Problems:** Phantom reads (new rows appearing)
- **Use Case:** Applications requiring consistent data within transaction

###### Serializable
- **Level:** Highest isolation
- **Characteristics:** Transactions execute as if run sequentially
- **Problems:** Reduced concurrency, potential deadlocks
- **Use Case:** Critical financial transactions

**Isolation Problems:**
```sql
-- Dirty Read Example
Transaction A: UPDATE accounts SET balance = 1000 WHERE id = 1;
Transaction B: SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1; -- Reads 1000
Transaction A: ROLLBACK; -- Balance reverts to original value
-- Transaction B read uncommitted data
```

##### Durability
**Definition:** Committed transactions persist even in case of system failures.

**Implementation:**
- **Write-Ahead Logging:** Changes logged before being written to disk
- **Checkpoints:** Periodic synchronization of memory and disk
- **Backup and Recovery:** Regular backups and point-in-time recovery
- **Replication:** Data copies across multiple systems

### üîÑ CAP Theorem and BASE in NoSQL

The CAP theorem and BASE properties represent fundamental trade-offs in distributed database systems, particularly relevant for NoSQL databases.

#### CAP Theorem in Database Context

**Consistency:**
- **Definition:** All nodes see the same data simultaneously
- **Database Implication:** All replicas have identical data at any given time
- **Implementation:** Synchronous replication, distributed locks

**Availability:**
- **Definition:** System remains operational despite failures
- **Database Implication:** Database responds to queries even during network partitions
- **Implementation:** Replication, failover mechanisms

**Partition Tolerance:**
- **Definition:** System continues operating despite network failures
- **Database Implication:** Database functions when communication between nodes fails
- **Implementation:** Distributed architecture, message queues

#### CAP Theorem Trade-offs in Databases

##### CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)
**Characteristics:**
- Sacrifice availability for consistency
- System may become unavailable during network partitions
- Strong consistency guarantees

**Examples:**
- **MongoDB:** Provides strong consistency with automatic failover
- **Redis Cluster:** Maintains consistency but may reject writes during partitions
- **HBase:** Consistent data access with potential unavailability

**Use Cases:**
- Financial systems requiring accurate balances
- Inventory management systems
- Systems where stale data is unacceptable

##### AP Systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance)
**Characteristics:**
- Sacrifice consistency for availability
- System remains available but may serve stale data
- Eventual consistency model

**Examples:**
- **Cassandra:** Highly available with tunable consistency
- **DynamoDB:** Always available with eventual consistency
- **CouchDB:** Multi-master replication with conflict resolution

**Use Cases:**
- Social media applications
- Content management systems
- Applications where availability is more important than immediate consistency

##### CA Systems (Consistency + Availability)
**Characteristics:**
- Cannot handle network partitions
- Typically single-node or tightly coupled systems
- Traditional relational databases

**Examples:**
- **MySQL (single node):** Consistent and available but not partition tolerant
- **PostgreSQL (single node):** Strong consistency but no distributed capabilities

#### BASE Properties

BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) provides an alternative to ACID properties for distributed systems.

##### Basically Available
**Definition:** System remains available even during partial failures.

**Implementation:**
- **Graceful Degradation:** Reduced functionality rather than complete failure
- **Partial Responses:** Return available data even if some nodes are down
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute requests across available nodes

**Example:**
```javascript
// Cassandra query with degraded service
try {
    result = cassandra.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [userId]);
} catch (UnavailableException e) {
    // Return cached data or default values
    result = getFromCache(userId) || getDefaultUserData();
}
```

##### Soft State
**Definition:** System state may change over time without input due to eventual consistency.

**Characteristics:**
- Data may be inconsistent across replicas temporarily
- No guarantees about state consistency at any given time
- Background processes eventually synchronize data

**Example:**
```javascript
// Data may be different across replicas
replica1.get("user:123").name // "John Smith"
replica2.get("user:123").name // "John Doe" (not yet synchronized)
// Eventually both will converge to the same value
```

##### Eventual Consistency
**Definition:** System will become consistent over time, given that no new updates are made.

**Types:**
- **Causal Consistency:** Causally related operations appear in the same order
- **Read-your-writes:** Users see their own writes immediately
- **Session Consistency:** Consistency within a single session
- **Monotonic Read:** If a process reads a value, subsequent reads return the same or more recent values

**Implementation Strategies:**
- **Vector Clocks:** Track causality in distributed systems
- **Conflict Resolution:** Last-write-wins, merge functions
- **Anti-entropy:** Background processes to synchronize replicas
- **Gossip Protocols:** Nodes share state information periodically

### üîÄ Partitioning, Sharding, and Replication

These techniques enable databases to scale beyond single-machine limitations by distributing data across multiple nodes.

#### Database Partitioning

**Definition:** Dividing a database into smaller, more manageable pieces while maintaining logical unity.

##### Vertical Partitioning
**Approach:** Split tables by columns
**Benefits:** Reduce I/O for queries accessing specific columns
**Challenges:** Complex joins across partitions

**Example:**
```sql
-- Original table
Users (ID, Name, Email, Bio, Avatar, LastLogin, CreatedAt)

-- Vertical partitioning
UserBasic (ID, Name, Email, LastLogin, CreatedAt)
UserProfile (ID, Bio, Avatar)
```

##### Horizontal Partitioning
**Approach:** Split tables by rows
**Benefits:** Distribute data volume across multiple storage units
**Challenges:** Cross-partition queries and transactions

**Example:**
```sql
-- Partition by date range
Orders_2023 (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, Amount)
Orders_2024 (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, Amount)

-- Partition by hash
Users_Shard1 (ID, Name, Email) -- IDs 1-1000000
Users_Shard2 (ID, Name, Email) -- IDs 1000001-2000000
```

#### Database Sharding

**Definition:** Horizontal partitioning across multiple database instances, each running on separate servers.

##### Sharding Strategies

###### Range-Based Sharding
**Approach:** Partition data based on value ranges
**Benefits:** Good for range queries, natural data distribution
**Challenges:** Hot spots if data distribution is uneven

**Example:**
```sql
-- Shard by user ID ranges
Shard1: Users with ID 1-100000
Shard2: Users with ID 100001-200000
Shard3: Users with ID 200001-300000

-- Query routing
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 150000; -- Route to Shard2
```

###### Hash-Based Sharding
**Approach:** Use hash function to determine shard placement
**Benefits:** Even data distribution, simple implementation
**Challenges:** Difficult range queries, resharding complexity

**Example:**
```sql
-- Hash-based sharding
shard_id = hash(user_id) % number_of_shards

-- Example with 4 shards
hash(12345) % 4 = 1 -- User goes to Shard1
hash(67890) % 4 = 2 -- User goes to Shard2
```

###### Directory-Based Sharding
**Approach:** Lookup service maintains mapping of data to shards
**Benefits:** Flexible, easy to rebalance
**Challenges:** Directory becomes bottleneck and single point of failure

**Example:**
```sql
-- Directory service
Directory Table:
UserID_Range | Shard_Server
1-100000     | shard1.example.com
100001-200000| shard2.example.com
200001-300000| shard3.example.com
```

###### Consistent Hashing
**Approach:** Hash ring with virtual nodes for better distribution
**Benefits:** Minimal data movement during scaling
**Challenges:** Complex implementation, uneven load possible

##### Sharding Challenges

**Cross-Shard Queries:**
```sql
-- Complex query across multiple shards
SELECT u.name, COUNT(o.id) as order_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
GROUP BY u.id
-- Requires querying multiple shards and aggregating results
```

**Distributed Transactions:**
```sql
-- Transaction spanning multiple shards
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- Update inventory in Shard1
    UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 1 WHERE product_id = 123;
    -- Create order in Shard2
    INSERT INTO orders (user_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES (456, 123, 1);
COMMIT;
-- Requires two-phase commit protocol
```

#### Database Replication

**Definition:** Maintaining multiple copies of data across different database servers for availability and performance.

##### Replication Types

###### Master-Slave Replication
**Architecture:** One primary (master) server, multiple secondary (slave) servers
**Benefits:** Read scaling, automatic failover capability
**Challenges:** Write bottleneck, replication lag

**Example:**
```sql
-- Master server (handles all writes)
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John', 'john@example.com');

-- Slave servers (handle reads)
-- Slight delay due to replication lag
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@example.com';
```

###### Master-Master Replication
**Architecture:** Multiple servers can handle both reads and writes
**Benefits:** High availability, geographic distribution
**Challenges:** Conflict resolution, data consistency

**Example:**
```sql
-- Server A and Server B both accept writes
Server A: UPDATE users SET email = 'john.new@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
Server B: UPDATE users SET email = 'john.old@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
-- Conflict resolution needed
```

###### Multi-Master Replication
**Architecture:** Multiple masters with conflict resolution
**Benefits:** High availability, load distribution
**Challenges:** Complex conflict resolution, eventual consistency

##### Replication Strategies

**Synchronous Replication:**
- **Characteristics:** Write confirmed only after all replicas updated
- **Benefits:** Strong consistency, no data loss
- **Drawbacks:** Higher latency, reduced availability

**Asynchronous Replication:**
- **Characteristics:** Write confirmed immediately, replicas updated later
- **Benefits:** Low latency, high availability
- **Drawbacks:** Potential data loss, eventual consistency

**Semi-Synchronous Replication:**
- **Characteristics:** Write confirmed after at least one replica updated
- **Benefits:** Balance between consistency and performance
- **Drawbacks:** Increased complexity

### üöÄ Query Optimization

Query optimization is the process of improving database query performance through various techniques and strategies.

#### Query Execution Process

**Steps:**
1. **Parsing:** Syntax and semantic analysis
2. **Optimization:** Generate execution plans
3. **Execution:** Execute the optimal plan
4. **Result Delivery:** Return results to client

#### Query Optimization Techniques

##### Index Optimization
**Strategy:** Use appropriate indexes for query patterns
**Implementation:**
```sql
-- Slow query without index
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Create index
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- Now query uses index for fast lookup
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

##### Query Rewriting
**Strategy:** Transform queries into more efficient forms
**Examples:**
```sql
-- Original query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM orders WHERE amount > 100
);

-- Rewritten using JOIN (often faster)
SELECT DISTINCT u.* FROM users u
INNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.amount > 100;
```

##### Predicate Pushdown
**Strategy:** Move filtering conditions as early as possible in execution
**Example:**
```sql
-- Inefficient: filter after join
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT u.*, o.amount FROM users u
    JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
) combined
WHERE combined.amount > 100;

-- Efficient: filter before join
SELECT u.*, o.amount FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.amount > 100;
```

##### Join Optimization
**Strategies:**
- **Join Order:** Optimize order of join operations
- **Join Algorithms:** Choose appropriate join algorithm (nested loop, hash join, merge join)
- **Statistics:** Maintain accurate table statistics for cost estimation

**Example:**
```sql
-- Query with multiple joins
SELECT u.name, p.title, o.amount
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id
WHERE u.created_at > '2023-01-01'
AND p.category = 'electronics';

-- Optimizer considers:
-- 1. Which table to scan first
-- 2. Join order based on selectivity
-- 3. Available indexes
```

#### Query Performance Analysis

##### Execution Plan Analysis
**Tools:**
- **EXPLAIN:** Shows query execution plan
- **ANALYZE:** Provides actual execution statistics
- **Visual Explain:** Graphical representation of execution plan

**Example:**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT u.name, COUNT(o.id) as order_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.name;

-- Output shows:
-- - Table scan vs index scan
-- - Join algorithm used
-- - Estimated vs actual rows
-- - Execution time breakdown
```

##### Performance Metrics
**Key Metrics:**
- **Rows Examined:** Number of rows scanned
- **Rows Returned:** Number of rows in result set
- **Execution Time:** Total query duration
- **I/O Operations:** Disk reads and writes
- **Memory Usage:** Temporary table sizes

#### Query Optimization Best Practices

##### Schema Design
**Principles:**
- **Appropriate Data Types:** Use smallest suitable data types
- **Normalization Balance:** Normalize for consistency, denormalize for performance
- **Index Strategy:** Create indexes for common query patterns
- **Partitioning:** Partition large tables for better performance

##### Query Writing
**Best Practices:**
- **Selective WHERE Clauses:** Use highly selective conditions early
- **Avoid Functions in WHERE:** Functions prevent index usage
- **Use EXISTS Instead of IN:** EXISTS often more efficient for subqueries
- **Limit Result Sets:** Use LIMIT to restrict returned rows

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Avoid functions in WHERE clause
-- Inefficient
SELECT * FROM users WHERE UPPER(name) = 'JOHN';

-- Efficient
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John';

-- Use EXISTS instead of IN for better performance
-- Less efficient
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM orders WHERE amount > 100
);

-- More efficient
SELECT * FROM users WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE user_id = users.id AND amount > 100
);
```
