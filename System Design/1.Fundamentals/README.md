# System Design Fundamentals

## Overview
This section covers the essential concepts and principles that form the foundation of system design. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for designing scalable, reliable, and efficient distributed systems.

## Core Topics

### üèóÔ∏è Client-Server Architecture
The fundamental architectural pattern where clients (users/applications) request services from servers (systems that provide resources or services). This model forms the basis of most distributed systems and web applications. The architecture is built on the principle of distributed computing where computational tasks are divided between service providers (servers) and service requesters (clients), enabling centralized data management, resource sharing, and scalable system design through clear contract-based interactions.

**Key Concepts:**
- Request-response pattern
- Stateless vs stateful servers
- Multi-tier architecture
- Separation of concerns

### üîå RESTful APIs and RPC
Two primary approaches for communication between distributed components:
- **REST (Representational State Transfer):** Architectural style using HTTP methods and stateless communication, based on Roy Fielding's architectural constraints that emphasize uniform interfaces and resource-based interactions
- **RPC (Remote Procedure Call):** Protocol allowing programs to execute procedures on remote systems by abstracting network communication to make remote function calls appear as local function calls, hiding the complexity of network protocols and serialization

**Key Considerations:**
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Resource-based vs action-based design
- Synchronous vs asynchronous RPC
- Protocol choices (HTTP, gRPC, message queues)

### ‚ö° Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication
Different patterns for how components interact with each other:
- **Synchronous:** Blocking communication where the caller waits for a response, following a blocking I/O model where the calling process is suspended until the operation completes, creating temporal coupling between components
- **Asynchronous:** Non-blocking communication allowing parallel processing, implementing non-blocking I/O that allows processes to continue execution while operations complete in the background, often employing event-driven architectures and message-passing paradigms

**Trade-offs:**
- Latency vs throughput
- System complexity vs performance
- Error handling strategies

### üìà Scalability: Horizontal vs Vertical
Approaches to handle increasing system load, rooted in parallel processing theory and distributed computing principles:
- **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up):** Adding more power to existing machines, limited by hardware constraints and following diminishing returns due to physical limitations of single-machine architectures
- **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out):** Adding more machines to the pool of resources, leveraging distributed computing principles to allow theoretically unlimited growth while introducing complexity in coordination, data consistency, and network communication

**Considerations:**
- Cost implications
- Complexity of implementation
- Limits and bottlenecks
- Fault tolerance benefits

### ‚è±Ô∏è Throughput vs Latency
Critical performance metrics that often require trade-offs based on queuing theory and system optimization principles:
- **Throughput:** Number of requests processed per unit time, measuring the system's capacity to handle workload volume
- **Latency:** Time taken to process a single request, measuring the responsiveness of individual operations and directly affecting user experience

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Caching for reduced latency
- Batching for improved throughput
- Load balancing for both metrics

### üõ°Ô∏è Availability, Reliability, and Fault Tolerance
Core system qualities that ensure consistent service delivery, based on reliability engineering principles and fault-tolerant system design:
- **Availability:** System uptime percentage (99.9%, 99.99%, etc.), measuring the proportion of time a system is operational and accessible
- **Reliability:** Consistent performance over time, measuring the system's ability to perform its intended function without failure
- **Fault Tolerance:** System's ability to continue operating despite failures, implementing redundancy and graceful degradation to maintain service continuity

**Design Patterns:**
- Redundancy and replication
- Circuit breakers
- Graceful degradation
- Health checks and monitoring

### üîÑ Consistency Models
Different approaches to data consistency in distributed systems, addressing the fundamental challenge of maintaining data coherence across multiple nodes:
- **Strong Consistency:** All nodes see the same data simultaneously, ensuring immediate consistency at the cost of availability and performance
- **Eventual Consistency:** System will become consistent over time, allowing temporary inconsistencies to achieve better availability and partition tolerance
- **Causal Consistency:** Causally related operations are seen in the same order, preserving the logical ordering of dependent operations while allowing concurrent operations to be seen in different orders

**Use Cases:**
- Financial systems (strong consistency)
- Social media feeds (eventual consistency)
- Collaborative editing (causal consistency)

### ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancing
Distributing incoming requests across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization and prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck, implementing algorithms that consider server capacity, current load, and response times:
- **Round Robin:** Requests distributed sequentially, providing simple and fair distribution
- **Least Connections:** Routes to server with fewest active connections, optimizing for varying request processing times
- **Weighted:** Assigns different weights to servers based on capacity, allowing heterogeneous server configurations

**Types:**
- Layer 4 (Transport) vs Layer 7 (Application)
- Hardware vs software load balancers
- Global vs local load balancing

### üóÑÔ∏è Caching Strategies
Storing frequently accessed data in fast storage for quick retrieval, based on the principle of temporal and spatial locality where recently accessed data is likely to be accessed again:
- **Client-side Caching:** Browser cache, mobile app cache that reduces server load and improves user experience
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** Geographic distribution of static content to reduce latency through proximity
- **Server-side Caching:** Application cache, database cache that reduces database load and improves response times

**Cache Patterns:**
- Cache-aside (lazy loading)
- Write-through
- Write-behind (write-back)
- Cache invalidation strategies

### üîÄ Data Partitioning and Sharding
Techniques for distributing data across multiple databases or servers to overcome the limitations of single-machine storage and processing capacity:
- **Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding):** Splitting rows across databases based on partition keys, distributing data volume and query load
- **Vertical Partitioning:** Splitting columns across databases, separating frequently and infrequently accessed data or grouping related columns
- **Functional Partitioning:** Splitting by feature or service, organizing data based on business domains or application modules

**Sharding Strategies:**
- Range-based sharding
- Hash-based sharding
- Directory-based sharding
- Consistent hashing

### ‚ö° CAP Theorem
Fundamental principle stating that distributed systems can only guarantee two of three properties, formalized by Eric Brewer as a theoretical framework for understanding trade-offs in distributed systems:
- **Consistency:** All nodes see the same data at the same time, ensuring data integrity across all replicas
- **Availability:** System remains operational and responsive to requests, maintaining service continuity
- **Partition Tolerance:** System continues despite network failures or communication breakdowns between nodes

**Practical Implications:**
- CP systems (sacrifice availability)
- AP systems (sacrifice consistency)
- Real-world trade-offs and design decisions
