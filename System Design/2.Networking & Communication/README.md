# Networking & Communication

## Overview
This section covers the essential networking protocols and communication mechanisms that form the backbone of distributed systems. Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing efficient, scalable, and reliable networked applications.

## Core Topics

### üåê HTTP/HTTPS Basics
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web, while HTTPS adds a security layer through SSL/TLS encryption. HTTP is a stateless, request-response protocol that operates on top of TCP, enabling clients and servers to communicate through standardized methods and status codes.

**HTTP Methods:**
- **GET:** Retrieve data from server (idempotent, cacheable)
- **POST:** Submit data to server (non-idempotent, not cacheable)
- **PUT:** Update/replace resource (idempotent)
- **DELETE:** Remove resource (idempotent)
- **PATCH:** Partial update of resource
- **HEAD:** Retrieve headers only (like GET but without body)
- **OPTIONS:** Check allowed methods for resource

**HTTP Status Codes:**
- **1xx (Informational):** Request received, continuing process
- **2xx (Success):** Request successfully received, understood, and accepted
  - 200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content
- **3xx (Redirection):** Further action needed to complete request
  - 301 Moved Permanently, 302 Found, 304 Not Modified
- **4xx (Client Error):** Request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
  - 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 429 Too Many Requests
- **5xx (Server Error):** Server failed to fulfill valid request
  - 500 Internal Server Error, 502 Bad Gateway, 503 Service Unavailable

**HTTPS Security Features:**
- **Encryption:** Data transmitted is encrypted using TLS/SSL
- **Authentication:** Server identity verified through certificates
- **Integrity:** Data cannot be tampered with during transmission
- **Certificate Chain:** Hierarchical trust model through Certificate Authorities (CA)

**HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Improvements:**
- **HTTP/2:** Multiplexing, server push, binary protocol, header compression
- **HTTP/3:** Built on QUIC protocol, reduced latency, improved connection establishment

### üîå WebSockets and Long Polling
Real-time communication mechanisms that enable bidirectional data flow between clients and servers, solving the limitations of traditional HTTP request-response patterns for interactive applications.

**WebSockets:**
WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time data exchange with low latency and overhead. The protocol starts with an HTTP handshake that upgrades the connection to WebSocket protocol.

**WebSocket Characteristics:**
- **Full-duplex:** Both client and server can send data simultaneously
- **Low latency:** No HTTP headers overhead after initial handshake
- **Persistent connection:** Connection remains open for the session duration
- **Real-time:** Immediate data transmission without polling
- **Cross-origin support:** CORS policies apply to WebSocket connections

**WebSocket Use Cases:**
- Chat applications and messaging systems
- Real-time gaming and multiplayer interactions
- Live data feeds (stock prices, sports scores)
- Collaborative editing tools
- IoT device communication
- Real-time notifications and alerts

**Long Polling:**
Long polling is a technique where the client sends a request to the server, and the server holds the request open until new data is available or a timeout occurs. This creates a pseudo-real-time communication pattern using standard HTTP.

**Long Polling Process:**
1. Client sends HTTP request to server
2. Server holds request open (doesn't respond immediately)
3. When data becomes available, server responds with data
4. Client processes response and immediately sends new request
5. Process repeats, creating continuous communication

**Comparison: WebSockets vs Long Polling:**
- **Latency:** WebSockets have lower latency due to no HTTP overhead
- **Complexity:** Long polling is simpler to implement and debug
- **Scalability:** WebSockets are more efficient for high-frequency communication
- **Firewall/Proxy:** Long polling works better with corporate firewalls
- **Fallback:** Long polling can serve as fallback for WebSocket failures

### üöÄ TCP vs UDP
Two fundamental transport layer protocols that provide different approaches to data transmission, each optimized for specific use cases and requirements.

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
TCP is a connection-oriented, reliable protocol that ensures data delivery through acknowledgments, retransmission, and ordered packet delivery. It implements flow control and congestion control mechanisms to optimize network utilization.

**TCP Characteristics:**
- **Connection-oriented:** Establishes connection before data transmission (3-way handshake)
- **Reliable delivery:** Guarantees data delivery through acknowledgments and retransmission
- **Ordered delivery:** Data arrives in the same order it was sent
- **Flow control:** Manages data transmission rate based on receiver capacity
- **Congestion control:** Adjusts transmission rate based on network conditions
- **Error detection:** Checksums detect corrupted data
- **Full-duplex:** Simultaneous bidirectional communication

**TCP Use Cases:**
- Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Email transmission (SMTP, POP3, IMAP)
- File transfers (FTP, SFTP)
- Database connections
- API communications
- Any application requiring reliable data delivery

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
UDP is a connectionless, unreliable protocol that provides fast, low-overhead data transmission without guarantees of delivery, ordering, or error correction. It's designed for applications where speed is more important than reliability.

**UDP Characteristics:**
- **Connectionless:** No connection establishment required
- **Unreliable:** No guarantee of data delivery or ordering
- **Low overhead:** Minimal protocol headers and processing
- **Fast transmission:** No acknowledgments or retransmissions
- **Broadcasting support:** Can send data to multiple recipients
- **No congestion control:** Application must handle network congestion
- **Stateless:** Each packet is independent

**UDP Use Cases:**
- Video streaming and live broadcasts
- Online gaming (real-time multiplayer)
- DNS queries (fast lookups)
- DHCP (network configuration)
- Real-time communication (VoIP)
- IoT sensor data transmission
- Network time synchronization (NTP)

**TCP vs UDP Trade-offs:**
- **Reliability vs Speed:** TCP ensures delivery, UDP prioritizes speed
- **Overhead:** TCP has higher overhead due to connection management
- **Use case fit:** Choose based on application requirements
- **Error handling:** TCP handles errors automatically, UDP requires application-level handling

### üåç DNS and CDN
Critical infrastructure components that optimize content delivery and enable the translation of human-readable domain names to IP addresses, forming the foundation of web-based communications.

**DNS (Domain Name System):**
DNS is a hierarchical, distributed naming system that translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling users to access websites using memorable names instead of numeric IP addresses.

**DNS Hierarchy:**
- **Root servers:** Top-level servers managing the root zone
- **Top-level domain (TLD) servers:** Manage domains like .com, .org, .net
- **Authoritative servers:** Store actual DNS records for specific domains
- **Recursive resolvers:** Query other DNS servers on behalf of clients

**DNS Record Types:**
- **A Record:** Maps domain to IPv4 address
- **AAAA Record:** Maps domain to IPv6 address
- **CNAME Record:** Creates alias for another domain
- **MX Record:** Specifies mail exchange servers
- **TXT Record:** Stores text information (often for verification)
- **NS Record:** Specifies authoritative name servers
- **SOA Record:** Contains administrative information about domain

**DNS Resolution Process:**
1. Client queries local DNS resolver
2. Resolver checks cache for existing record
3. If not cached, resolver queries root servers
4. Root servers respond with TLD server information
5. Resolver queries TLD servers for authoritative servers
6. Authoritative servers provide final IP address
7. Resolver caches result and returns to client

**CDN (Content Delivery Network):**
CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that cache and deliver content to users from the nearest location, reducing latency and improving performance.

**CDN Architecture:**
- **Edge servers:** Distributed servers close to end users
- **Origin servers:** Primary servers containing original content
- **Pop (Point of Presence):** CDN server locations in different regions
- **Cache hierarchy:** Multi-level caching from edge to origin

**CDN Benefits:**
- **Reduced latency:** Content served from geographically closer servers
- **Improved availability:** Redundancy through multiple server locations
- **Scalability:** Distributes load across multiple servers
- **Bandwidth optimization:** Reduces origin server load
- **DDoS protection:** Distributes and absorbs malicious traffic
- **Cost efficiency:** Reduces bandwidth costs for origin servers

**CDN Caching Strategies:**
- **Static content caching:** Images, CSS, JavaScript files
- **Dynamic content caching:** API responses, personalized content
- **Edge computing:** Processing and computation at edge locations
- **Cache invalidation:** Updating or removing cached content
- **TTL (Time to Live):** Controlling cache duration

### ‚ö° Rate Limiting and Throttling
Essential mechanisms for protecting systems from abuse, ensuring fair resource allocation, and maintaining service quality under high load conditions.

**Rate Limiting:**
Rate limiting controls the number of requests a client can make to a service within a specific time window, preventing abuse and ensuring system stability.

**Rate Limiting Algorithms:**
- **Token Bucket:** Tokens are added to bucket at fixed rate; requests consume tokens
- **Leaky Bucket:** Requests are processed at fixed rate; excess requests are discarded
- **Fixed Window:** Allows fixed number of requests per time window
- **Sliding Window:** Uses moving time window for more precise control
- **Sliding Window Log:** Maintains log of request timestamps for accurate tracking

**Rate Limiting Implementation Levels:**
- **Application level:** Implemented in application code
- **API Gateway level:** Centralized rate limiting for multiple services
- **Load balancer level:** Network-level rate limiting
- **Infrastructure level:** Firewall or network equipment rate limiting

**Rate Limiting Strategies:**
- **Per-user limits:** Different limits for different user types
- **Per-IP limits:** Limits based on client IP addresses
- **Per-API endpoint limits:** Different limits for different endpoints
- **Global limits:** Overall system-wide limits
- **Distributed rate limiting:** Coordination across multiple servers

**Throttling:**
Throttling is a broader concept that includes rate limiting but also encompasses other techniques to control system load and resource usage.

**Throttling Techniques:**
- **Request queuing:** Queuing excess requests for later processing
- **Request prioritization:** Processing high-priority requests first
- **Circuit breakers:** Stopping requests when system is overloaded
- **Load shedding:** Dropping low-priority requests during high load
- **Backpressure:** Slowing down upstream systems when downstream is overwhelmed

**Response Strategies:**
- **HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests):** Standard response for rate limiting
- **Retry-After header:** Indicates when client can retry
- **Exponential backoff:** Increasing delay between retries
- **Graceful degradation:** Providing reduced functionality instead of failure

**Monitoring and Metrics:**
- **Request rate tracking:** Monitoring requests per second/minute
- **Error rate monitoring:** Tracking throttled requests
