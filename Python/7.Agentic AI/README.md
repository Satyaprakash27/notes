## What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act autonomously, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals without constant human intervention. Unlike traditional AI systems that simply respond to inputs, agentic AI systems are:

- **Goal-oriented**: They work towards specific objectives
- **Autonomous**: They can operate independently and make decisions
- **Adaptive**: They can adjust their strategies based on feedback and changing conditions
- **Proactive**: They can initiate actions rather than just responding
- **Persistent**: They continue working towards goals over extended periods

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Agency**: The ability to act independently
2. **Reasoning**: Advanced problem-solving capabilities
3. **Planning**: Creating and executing multi-step strategies
4. **Tool Usage**: Ability to use external tools and APIs
5. **Memory**: Maintaining context and learning from experiences
6. **Communication**: Interacting with other agents and humans

## Agentic AI vs Regular LLM Pipelines

| Aspect | Regular LLM Pipelines | Agentic AI |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| **Interaction Model** | Single request-response | Continuous, iterative workflows |
| **Decision Making** | Reactive to prompts | Proactive and autonomous |
| **Goal Achievement** | Task completion per request | Long-term goal pursuit |
| **Tool Integration** | Limited or pre-defined | Dynamic tool selection and usage |
| **Memory** | Context within conversation | Persistent memory across sessions |
| **Planning** | Single-step responses | Multi-step planning and execution |
| **Adaptability** | Fixed behavior patterns | Adaptive strategies based on feedback |
| **Collaboration** | Isolated operations | Multi-agent coordination |

### Regular LLM Pipeline Example:
```
User Input → LLM Processing → Single Response → End
```

### Agentic AI Workflow Example:
```
Goal Definition → Planning → Tool Selection → Action Execution → 
Feedback Analysis → Strategy Adjustment → Continue Until Goal Achieved
```

## What is CrewAI?

**CrewAI** is a powerful framework for building and orchestrating multi-agent AI systems. It allows developers to create teams of AI agents that work together to accomplish complex tasks.

### Core Features:
- **Agent Definition**: Create specialized agents with specific roles and capabilities
- **Task Management**: Define and assign tasks to appropriate agents
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Manage the flow of work between agents
- **Tool Integration**: Equip agents with various tools and capabilities
- **Communication**: Enable seamless agent-to-agent communication
- **Result Aggregation**: Combine outputs from multiple agents

### Key Components:

#### 1. Agents
```python
from crewai import Agent

researcher = Agent(
    role='Research Specialist',
    goal='Gather comprehensive information on given topics',
    backstory='Expert researcher with access to various data sources',
    tools=[search_tool, web_scraper]
)
```

#### 2. Tasks
```python
from crewai import Task

research_task = Task(
    description='Research the latest trends in AI',
    agent=researcher,
    expected_output='Detailed report with key findings'

```

#### 3. Crew (Team)
```python
from crewai import Crew

crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer, reviewer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task, review_task],
    process=Process.sequential
)
```

## A2A (AutoGPT-to-AutoGPT) Communication

**A2A Communication** refers to the ability of autonomous AI agents to communicate and collaborate with each other without human intervention. This enables:

### Communication Methods:
1. **Direct Messaging**: Agents send structured messages to each other
2. **Shared Memory**: Agents access common data stores
3. **Event-Driven**: Agents respond to events triggered by other agents
4. **Protocol-Based**: Using standardized communication protocols

### Benefits:
- **Scalability**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously
- **Specialization**: Each agent can focus on specific domains
- **Efficiency**: Parallel processing of complex tasks

        self.role = role
        self.system_prompt = system_prompt
        self.memory = []
    
    def process(self, task: str, context: Dict = None) -> str:
        messages = [
            {"role": "system", "content": self.system_prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": task}
        ]
        
        if context:
            messages.append({"role": "user", "content": f"Context: {json.dumps(context)}"})
        
        response = openai.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=messages
        )
        
        result = response.choices[0].message.content
        self.memory.append({"task": task, "result": result})
        return result

class AgenticWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {}

    def add_agent(self, agent: Agent):
        self.agents[agent.name] = agent
    
    def execute_workflow(self, workflow_steps: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
        results = {}
        
        for step in workflow_steps:
            agent_name = step["agent"]
            task = step["task"]
            depends_on = step.get("depends_on", [])
            
            # Gather context from previous steps
            context = {}
            for dependency in depends_on:
                if dependency in results:
                    context[dependency] = results[dependency]
            
            # Execute task
            agent = self.agents[agent_name]
            result = agent.process(task, context)
            results[step["name"]] = result
            
            # Update shared memory
            self.shared_memory[step["name"]] = {
                "agent": agent_name,
                "task": task,
